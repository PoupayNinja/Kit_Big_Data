The "Kit Big Data" course constituted a pivotal component of our Master of Science (MS) program of Artificial Intelligence. Within the purview of this course, we undertook a series of five projects, denoted as Project 1 through Project 5, each designed to deepen our proficiency in critical data science skills and techniques. These projects primarily encompassed aspects of data manipulation, with a predominant focus on the utilization of the Pandas DataFrame library, as well as the intricate art of web scraping to acquire pertinent data. Furthermore, a key facet of our course included the mastery of visual representation through the creation of data-driven graphics. The final project tracked the Vend√©e Globe event with the players trajectory, performance and main characteristics of their ships.
